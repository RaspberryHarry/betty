Quadcopter with RaspberryPi 

## Me
Im totally new in Python and electronics. Untill now i've only programmed in PHP.
If someone see's some unneccessary Parts in my Code, please tell me =)

Im a native German speaker, so sometimes, if im annoyed by not knowing some english expressions, i use german words to instead of english for some vars. If the hard work is done, I will change them.


### Sequence
Im buying step by step new Items to build Betty =).
Untill now i only got a RPi, an USB Dongle and a PS3 Controller.

More components are coming.

I managed to connect those to send commands, which shall be used to controll the Quadcopter.
